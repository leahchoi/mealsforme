# Meals for Me

- Recipe Finder is a mobile web application that allows users to input certain food ingredients in order to view what type of foods can be made with such ingredients. In addition, information about how to prepare and cook the food item is displayed. I was the project lead for this and worked with three other team members. We used mainly ReactJS and Redux on the front end with Axios calls to an API and PHP on the backend with a MySQL database.
